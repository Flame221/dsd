# Todo app using Routes, Private Routes, fake login and Redux to manage our data.

The idea of this project is to learn Redux and React-router-dom.
Was used Chakra UI.

## Private Routes

If you want to route into todo app first you need is be logged in.

## Redux to manage our data

Todos are made using Redux. Also, redux is used in this project to manage 'logged in' state.

## Try it for yourself. Proper data for logging in is: username: 'admin', password: 'password'
