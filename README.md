# Todo app using Routes, Private Routes, fake login and Redux to manage our data.

The idea of this project is to learn Redux and React-router-dom.
Was used Chakra UI.

## Private Routes

If you want to route to out todo app first you need is log in

## Redux to manage our data

Todos are made using the Redux. Also, redux is used in this project to menage our 'Logged in' state.

## Try it for yourself. Proper data for logging in is: username: 'admin', password: 'password'

### Form validation
